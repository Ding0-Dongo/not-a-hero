    D "By the way, Ellis, you'll be on your own for today. Is that alright?"
    e "What? On my own? Why?"
    D "I've got some maintenance that needs to be done, but it should be done before three in the afternoon."
    e "..."
    e "(He looks a little upset.)"
    D "You know who to go to if you need help, right?"

    e "*nods* ALPHA or PHI, but... I'm just... not sure if I'm ready to be running commissions on my own yet."
    e "*fidgets* DELTA, can't you... delay the maintenance for a bit?"
    D "Sorry, Ellis, but I'm already a couple months overdue."
    D "Besides, if I don't go in for maintenance, ALPHA will probably haul me in himself."
    e "*misses the humor* But-"
    D "Ellis. You'll be fine."
    e "But what if I mess something up? What if, what if I-"

        "Everyone messes up sometimes.":
            D "Everyone messes up sometimes. It's part of why you're in a TEAM, Ellis. Your TEAMmates will be there to help you."

        "Just believe in yourself.":
            D "Just believe in yourself. You won't mess it up, Ellis, you've done all these commissions a dozen times now. You could probably do them in your sleep."
            e "But-"


    D "Don't forget, Ellis, you know more than you think you do. You're already well on your way to becoming a full-fledged hero."
    e "..."
    D "I have to run now, but Ellis, really."
    D "It's just like those training sessions we've been doing, right? Practice is good for you, but remember to pace yourself. And-"
    e "And know when to stop, take a break sometimes. I... I know."
    D "... *smiles* I think you'll be just fine, Ellis."

    e "Thanks, DELTA."
    D "We'll see each other soon, alright? And don't get too cozy with ALPHA and PHI, I'm only gone for one day."
    e "*laughs* OK... see you later...?"
    D "See you."
