    d "Ellis, there you are. You wanted to talk about something?"
    e "*quickly turns around* Oh-! Desmond, yeah, I... I did."
    "(He notices Desmond looks more tired than usual.)"
    e "Um... you alright?"
    d "Huh?"
    e "It's just... you look like you didn't sleep well?"
    d "*waves a hand dismissively* Ellis, I'm busy. If you want to talk to me, make it quick."
    e "Right... sorry. I just... wanted to talk about yesterday. At... at the caf√©."
    d "*brow furrows* ...what about it?"
    "(Before Ellis can speak, Desmond continues.)"
    d "It's fine if you don't want to do the commission. Josephine already talked to me about it. We won't make you join us."
    e "No, I- please, let me explain. I just... I panicked yesterday. I should have... should have talked to you guys instead of just running away."
    d "Well, you're talking to us now. Water under the bridge."
    e "I want to join you guys, really, but... I'm just not ready yet. Maybe- maybe another week."
    d "*folds his arms* It's only one week, but I guess we could always do a different one next month."
    e "Oh, I... I'm sorry... (I'm going to delay his initiation as a full-fledged hero...)"
    e "(... I feel terrible. I might be sick.)"
    d "(nonchalant) It's whatever. *shrugs*"
    d "Was that all we had to talk about? If we're done here, I have to get back to my commissions."
    "(Ellis can only manage a nod in response. Desmond turns to leave.)"
    e "Desmond, you... you really throw yourself into your work when you're stressed, huh...?"
    d "..."
    d "I'll see you later, Ellis."
    "(Desmond leaves.)"
    e "(I thought talking things out would make me feel better... so why do I feel so awful?)"
