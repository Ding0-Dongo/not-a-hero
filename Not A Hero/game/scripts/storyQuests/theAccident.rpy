Day 7
	Scene: City
		Normington Elementary (outside) 02:00 PM
			(As Ellis arrives on the scene, huge black plumes of smoke rise up in the air. The school is on fire.)
				(Numerous squad cars and ambulances are on the scene. Crying children and worried parents are being reunited in the parking lot.)
					(Ellis sees Josephine in the middle of all the chaos.)
						*runs up* Josephine, what's- what's going on?
							*turns to see Ellis with a worried look on her face* Ellis! You're here!
								Desmond and I responded to the call. I've been patching up a few wounded kids. No one's majorly injured, thankfully.

*sigh of relief* I'm glad to hear that...
	*looks over at the burning building* But... where's Desmond?
		*she bites her lip with worry* That's just the thing... he's been going in and out of the school to help people out.
			*alarmed* Is he still in there?
				(screenshake)
					(The two of them wince and cover their ears as an explosion goes off somewhere in the school.)
						*nods* But I'm almost done with my work here - Ellis, we have to go in and get him out of there.
							Go in? In to the building? *looks at the smoke apprehensively*

You don't have to come if you don't want to, Ellis. I- I understand it sounds crazy.
	No, I... I want to come.
		(The stubbornness in Ellis's voice surprises both Josephine and himself.)
			... really? Ellis, I...
				(Josephine looks like she's about to say more, but stops herself.)
					Right. Just... promise me you'll stay close in that building, okay? We'll watch each other's backs.
						*nods*
							(The two of them hop the barriers and begin running into the building, despite firemen shouting at them not to go in.)
